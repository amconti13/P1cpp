Stat program (cpp): Mean, Median, Mode

Hello C++ / OOPP Homework due September 12
Program 1. Write a short program; you do not need to define a class for it. Ask me if you need clarification or help.
• Open a file named “randints.txt”, which is linked to the website.
• This file contains a large number of integers, one per line. These numbers are all in the range 0 to 99. Read the numbers and store them in an array or in a vector.
• Print out the mean, median, and mode of the set of integers.
• The mean is the average of the numbers, a double value.
• The median is the value in the middle of the list after the numbers are sorted.
• The mode is the value that occurs most frequently in the list. You will need a second array to tally the number of times each value appears.
